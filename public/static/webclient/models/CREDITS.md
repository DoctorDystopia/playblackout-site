# Model credits

Every model served from this directory, and the licence it arrived under.

**This file is the licence obligation, not a courtesy.** Most of what is
usable here is CC-BY, which requires the credit to travel with the work
wherever it is shared — so a model added without a row below is a licence
breach, not an untidy commit.

Add a row when `assets/pack_model.py` writes a new `.glb`, in the same commit.

- Packed with `assets/pack_model.py`, textures resampled 1024² → 512²
- Its two materials arrived as `KHR_materials_pbrSpecularGlossiness`, which the
  vendored GLTFLoader no longer reads; the packer rewrote both as core
  metallic-roughness. Both are dielectric, so the conversion is exact.
- Carries a 12-bone skin and five animations (`idle`, `movimiento`, `ataque`,
  `muerte`, `ArmatureAction`). Nothing plays them yet.

  tile is too small to show
